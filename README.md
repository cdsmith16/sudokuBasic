## Stanford CS Obj. Oriented Programming Assignment using recursion to solve Sudoku puzzles with Java.

## To try it:
- Execute the runnable jar.  This may be as simple as double clicking the downloaded file "sudokuRun.jar" or right-clicking and opening the application, depending your OS.
- Copy and paste a Sudoku puzzle in the following format:

	"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
	"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
	"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
	"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
	"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
	"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
	"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
	"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
	"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
  
  *replacing the '0' characters with numbers in your Sudoku!* Example:

 	"0 0 0 8 0 7 9 4 0",
	"9 0 0 0 0 6 5 0 0",
	"0 5 8 0 0 3 0 1 0",
	"7 1 0 0 3 0 0 2 0",
	"0 0 6 5 2 8 4 0 0",
	"0 4 0 0 7 0 0 6 5",
	"0 7 0 3 0 0 1 9 0",
	"0 0 1 7 0 0 0 0 4",
	"0 3 9 1 0 2 0 0 0"
  
- click "check" .  If you want the solver to check as soon as you enter in the numbers, leave "auto" checked.

## Notes
- Be sure to enter in 0-9 digits exclusively, with 0's representing spaces
- Enjoy & check out the java files in the repository for raw code
